        <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. (I set my convection oven to 325Â°F)</li>
              <li>In a bowl, combine cake mix, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla and the melted butter. Mash together with a fork until all ingredients are fully incorporated.</li>
              <li>Spray a 9-inch by 3-inch round cake pan or a 9-inch by 13-inch pan with baking spray or use a piece of parchment in the bottom of the pan.</li>
              <li>Press cake mixture into bottom of prepared pan and get it as flat as possible.</li>
              <li>Place cream cheese, remaining eggs, vanilla and melted butter in a stand mixer and beat on medium speed until creamy.</li>
              <li>Add in confectioners sugar 1 cup at a time (and on low speed) until all sugar has been added.</li>
              <li>Pour cream cheese mixture over cake mixture.</li>
              <li>Bake for 35-45 minutes. I moved mine from the oven when the edges were brown, but the center was still a bit jiggly. You do not want to over cook.</li>
              <li>Allow to cool before serving.</li>
